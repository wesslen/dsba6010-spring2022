<div id="what-you-will-learn" class="section level2">
<h2>What you will learn</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bayesian data analysis through <strong>probabilistic programming</strong> (R/Stan, Python/PyMC, Julia/Turing.jl)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Computational approaches</strong> for statistical modeling (quadratic approximation, sampling, MCMC, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Causal inference</strong> to develop robust statistical models and identify causal relationships</li>
<li>Machine learning techniques to <strong>reduce overfitting</strong> in statistical models (e.g., cross-validation, regularization, shrinkage, pooling)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="course-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Course overview</h2>
<p>This course builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data. Reflecting the need for scripting in today’s model-based statistics, students will perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that sufficient understanding to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.</p>
<p>We’ll cover causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. If time, we’ll discuss measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.</p>
<p>The course also includes directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference. Additional topics may include the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our goal is to go beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-philosophy" class="section level2">
<h2>Course philosophy</h2>
<p>Classical statistics classes spend substantial time covering probability theory, null hypothesis testing, and other statistical tests first developed hundreds of years ago. Some classes don’t use software or actual real data and instead live in the world of mathematical proofs. They can be math-heavy and full of often unintuitive concepts and equations.</p>
<p>In this class,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> we will take the opposite approach. We <em>begin</em> with data and learn how to use programming to draw inferences from statistical models.</p>
<p>In other words, there’s way less of this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Pr(W,L|p) = \dfrac{(W+L)!}{W!L!} p^{W}(1-p)^L
\]</span></p>
<p>And way more of this:</p>
<pre class="r language-r"><code>dbinom(6, 9, 0.7)
## [1] 0.27</code></pre>
<p>Over the last decade there has been a revolution in statistical and scientific computing. Open source languages like R and Python have overtaken older (and expensive!) corporate software packages like SAS and SPSS, and there are now thousands of books and blog posts and other online resources with excellent tutorials about how to analyze pretty much any kind of data.</p>
<p>This class will expose you to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>—one of the most popular, sought-after, and in-demand statistical programming languages. Armed with the foundation of R skills you’ll learn in this class, you’ll know enough to be able to find how to analyze any sort of data-based question in the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="important-pep-talk" class="section level2">
<h2>Important pep talk!</h2>
<p>I <em>promise</em> you can succeed in this class.</p>
<p>Learning Bayesian Statistics and R (or any programming language) can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like <code>ggplot2</code>—<a href="https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/">made this wise observation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.
Even experienced programmers and evaluators find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.</p>

<h2>Course materials</h2>
<div id="book-and-materials" class="section level3">
<h3>Book and materials <img src="/img/featured.png" width="150px" align="right" /></h3>
<p>There is one textbook for this course: Richard McElreath’s <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a>. It is very important that you purchase the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Rethinking-Bayesian-Examples-Chapman/dp/036713991X">2nd edition</a>. Simultaneously this semester, Richard is teaching an <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022">online version of his course</a>. We will leverage his online lectures, slides, and problem sets for our course. Richard has taught the course many times and his iterations has led to a course (<a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019">Winter 2019</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2020">Winter 2020</a>) much better than anything I could create.</p>
<p>I highly recommend viewing his <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">book website</a> that includes <a href="http://xcelab.net/rmpubs/sr2/code.txt">textbook code</a>, an <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/rethinking2/"><code>tidyverse</code> version of the code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking_2"><code>PyMC</code> (Python) version of the code</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia"><code>turing.jl</code> (Julia) version of the code</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="r-and-rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a>. You will use <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.</p>
<p>R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To help you, I’ve created (and will likely add additional) guides in the <a href="/resource/">Resources</a> section of the website. We’ll cover these in the first class.</p>
<p>{{% spoiler text="Can I use Python or Julia instead of R in the class?" %}}</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lectures, readings, and problem sets will use R. Students <strong>must complete</strong> problem sets in R and the exam may cover some R code examples.</p></li>
<li><p>However, final projects can be done in Python (e.g., pyMC) or Julia (turing.jl). We’ll likely have a class and/or guest lecture on Python (PyMC) and/or Julia later in the semester.</p></li>

<div id="online-help" class="section level3">
<h3>Online help</h3>
<p>Data science and statistical programming can be difficult. Computers are stupid and little errors in your code can cause hours of headache (even if you’ve been doing this stuff for years!).</p>
<p>Fortunately there are tons of online resources to help you with this. Two of the most important are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> (a Q&amp;A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio).</p>
<p>If you use Twitter, post R-related questions and content with <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats">#rstats</a>. The community there is exceptionally generous and helpful.</p>
<p>Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky because the program name is, um, a single letter. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r scatterplot”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats scatterplot”).</p>
<p>Additionally, we have a class chatroom at <a href="https://dsba6010-spring2022.slack.com/">Slack</a> where anyone in the class can ask questions and anyone can answer. <strong>I will monitor Slack regularly and will respond quickly.</strong> Ask questions about the readings, assignments, and project. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Course structure</h2>
<p>We meet weekly from 12:00-2:45 PM on Mondays in Center City 1101. This course will employ a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom">flipped classroom</a> teaching method.</p>
<p>We will <strong>not</strong> have lectures during our regularly scheduled class time. Instead, you will do the readings and watch recorded lecture videos prior to each in-person class session. You can do the readings and watch the videos on your own schedule at whatever time works best for you.
We will do several things during our Monday in-person classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Extensive Q&amp;A</strong>: As you do the readings and watch the videos prior to class, you will inevitably have questions. In your weekly check-in, you can submit (at least) 3 of those questions to me prior to class. We’ll spend a good chunk of each class answering, clarifying, debating, and discussing your questions. We’ll also review the lecture quiz due at the beginning of the class to ensure students are familar with the key concepts of the material</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Activities</strong>: In some weeks, we’ll do some in-class activities (labeled as <a href="/example/">examples</a>) to help solidify concepts about Bayesian statistics, causal inference, and programming. These will not be graded but may aid in upcoming problem set.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem sets</strong>: We’ll spend a substantial time during each class learning and working with R together on the problem sets. You’ll need to bring a computer.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="schedule" class="section level3">
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">course schedule is listed here</a>. In general, we’ll likely cover 1-2 of Richard’s lectures per course. However, there will be a few exceptions. This schedule may change per the instructor’s discretion.</p>
</div>
<div id="weekly-check-in" class="section level3">
<h3>Weekly check-in</h3>
<p>Every week, after you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. Because the content in this course is flipped, these questions are <strong>crucial</strong> for our weekly in-class discussions. To encourage engagement with the course content—and to allow me to collect the class’s questions each week—you’ll need to fill out a <a href="https://forms.gle/zMipNzav3BCL3Rwy9">short response on Google Forms</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assignments-and-grades" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignments and grades</h2>
<p>There are five components to your grade in the course.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Participation</strong>: Students will receive 5% of their grade based on participation. While I will not actively take attendance, this will be in large part a function of in-class participation (e.g., asking/answering questions, weekly check-ins) as well as out-of-class (e.g., Slack).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lecture quizzes</strong>: Before each class (due 11:59am of each class), students will complete a 5 question quiz on the due lecture/chapter. There will be a 15 minute timer and the quizzes will use Canvas. There are no late quizzes that will be accepted as we will review the quizzes first thing for each class. There are <strong>eleven (11)</strong> total quizzes; however, the <strong>two (2)</strong> lowest quizzes will be dropped at the end of the semester.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem sets</strong>: For each lecture, there will be an accompanying problem set. These problem sets will largely mimic those from Richard’s classes. <strong>The lowest problem set will be dropped.</strong> Problem sets late 48 hours will receive a <strong>50%</strong> reduction. Problem sets received after 48 hours will receive a zero. Please take note of <a href="/assignment/#problem-sets-1">the problem set grading rubrics</a>. For those problems reused from past classes, I will provide the answer keys before. However, likely there will be additional problems not from Richard’s class; those solutions will not be provided until after the course. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exam</strong>: There will be one in-class exam. It will be closed notes and based on chapter lectures, slides, and materials. It will be a blend of multiple choice (very similar to lecture quizzes) and short open ended questions (e.g., reading comprehension or explaining code snippets similar to problem sets).<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Final Project</strong>: The final project will provide students an opportunity to find an application for Bayesian inference. Part of the grade will be two check-in assignments including an in-class presentation on a Bayesian topic and a proposal assignment.</p></li>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<p>{{% spoiler text="What are the course prerequisites?" %}}</p>
<p><strong>Programming</strong>: Experience with R (e.g., installing packages, loading data, RStudio). Students without should immediately consider DataCamp courses and hands-on practice problems.</p>
<p><strong>Probability</strong>: Fundamental probability theory is highly recommended. This includes exposure to common distributions like Normal (Gaussian), Binomial, and Beta distributions.</p>
<p>We’ll also assume core understanding of statistical models like linear regression.</p>
