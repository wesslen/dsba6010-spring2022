## Comprehension questions

{{% spoiler text="What is Bayesian data analysis? How does it differ in its definition of uncertainty from Frequentist interpretations?" %}}
- An approach to **count all the ways data can happen** according to assumptions.

- Bayesian data analysis uses **probabilities** to describe uncertainty. Importantly, in Bayesian data analysis probabilities describe **degrees of belief**. In contrast, a frequentist interpretation of probabilities would be as the **frequencies of events in very large samples**.

- This leads to frequentist uncertainty being premised on **imaginary resampling of data**â€”if we were to repeat the measurement many many times, we would end up collecting a list of values that will have some pattern to it. It means also that parameters and models **cannot** have probability distributions, only measurements can.

{{% spoiler text="Classical (Frequentist) statistical tests were originally developed for what purposes?" %}}

- They were originally developed (largely by Ronald Fisher) in the early 20th century for agricultural applications. They typically were for randomized experiments with large effects, in which **measurement issues had been solved**.

- Such statistical tests produce inferences, **not decisions**.

{{% spoiler text="What is the core problem with null hypothesis testing?" %}}

- Null hypotheses are **not** unique. Hypotheses do not imply unique models, and models do not imply unique hypotheses.

- **Models are not hypotheses**; they are neither true or false. Models are "golems" that do as they are told. Ideally should **compare performance across models** (model comparison).

- Popper: **test (attempt to falsify) research hypothesis**. Use theory, make a falsifiable prediction, and test that; not that nothing happened (aka null hypothesis).
