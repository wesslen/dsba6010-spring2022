## Introduction

For this class, we'll review code examples found in the Preface.

This assumes that you have already installed the `rethinking` package.

If you need help, be sure to remember the references in the [Resources](/resource/):

* [Installing R/RStudio](/resource/install/)
* [Installing `rethinking` package](/resource/install-rethinking/)
* [Rmarkdown](/resource/rmarkdown/)

### R Principles

```{r}
## R code 0.1
print( "All models are wrong, but some are useful." )
```

```{r}
## R code 0.2
x <- 1:2
x <- x*10
x <- log(x)
x <- sum(x)
x <- exp(x)
x
```

```{r}
## R code 0.3
( log( 0.01^200 ) )
( 200 * log(0.01) )
```

```{r}
## R code 0.4
# Load the data:
# car braking distances in feet paired with speeds in km/h
# see ?cars for details
data(cars)
```

```{r}
# fit a linear regression of distance on speed
m <- lm( dist ~ speed , data=cars )

# estimated coefficients from the model
coef(m)
```

```{r}
# plot residuals against speed
plot( resid(m) ~ speed , data=cars )
```

## Package versions

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
