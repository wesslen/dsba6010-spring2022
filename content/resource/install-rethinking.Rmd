We'll primarily use Richard McElreath's `rethinking` R package. Installation can be a bit tricky so this guide will outline how to install as well as other packages that may be helpful in this class.

## `rethinking` package

The [package's github repository](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking) is the best source of information, especially the [issues](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/issues) section where likely if you run into errors, you may find tips to help install.

{{% callout note %}}

Richard updated the `rethinking` package [recently to v2.21](https://twitter.com/rlmcelreath/status/1476219290500149253?s=20). The biggest change is that the default Stan engine to `cmdstanr` instead of `rstan`.

### Install `rstan`

While this course uses R, the engine for running Bayesian is Stan. Stan is a C++ library that can be used in a variety of ways (R, Python, Julia, Command Line, etc.).

To get started, we'll use it with `rstan`, which is the R package aligned to calling Stan.

To install it, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

You can find more information about [`rstan` on its website](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html) or you can view the [Stan User Guide](https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_28/stan-users-guide/index.html).

To test whether you properly installed `rstan`, try running this (see original [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/rasmusab/744410db9cf85ecb85e1)):

```{r}
set.seed(123)
y <- rbinom(30, size = 1, prob = 0.2016)

y
```

```{r}
# Fitting a simple binomial model using Stan
library(rstan)
```

```{r}
model_string <- "
data {
  int n;
  int y[n];
}
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
}
model {
  y ~ bernoulli(theta);
}"

stan_samples <- stan(
  model_code = model_string, 
  data = list(y = y, n = length(y)),
  seed = 123, 
  chains = 4, 
  refresh = 500
)
```

```{r}
stan_samples
```

```{r}
traceplot(stan_samples)
plot(stan_samples)
```

Did you get similar output?

### Install `cmdstanr`

Like all things, Stan is going through changes and moving forward, `rstan` is falling out of favor and instead much more development will be used with `cmdstanr` rather than `rstan` ([here's a comparison](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html#comparison-with-rstan)). 

The `rethinking` package works with either of these packages but it's likely much better to use `cmdstanr` instead of `stanr`; therefore, Richard (and I) recommend installing both. <https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/>

To install `cmdstanr`, you'll need to install that from github (non-CRAN library).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# if you get an error, do you have devtools installed? 
devtools::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
```

After you've installed it, if it's your first time you'll need to run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# see https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/reference/install_cmdstan.html
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

To check if it was installed correctly, run:

```{r}
cmdstanr::check_cmdstan_toolchain()
```

```{r}
library(cmdstanr)
```

```{r}
file <- file.path(cmdstan_path(), "examples", "bernoulli", "bernoulli.stan")

mod <- cmdstan_model(file)
fit <- mod$sample(
  data = list(y = y, N = length(y)), # recall y from earlier example
  seed = 123, 
  chains = 4, 
  parallel_chains = 4,
  refresh = 500
)
```

```{r}
fit$summary()
```
### Install `rethinking`

Now with both `rstan` and `cmdstanr`, you can install `rethinking`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("coda","mvtnorm","devtools","loo","dagitty"))
devtools::install_github("rmcelreath/rethinking")
```

We can do a few functions to check to see if `rethinking` was installed correctly.

```{r}
library(rethinking)
```

```{r}
f <- alist(
    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),
    mu ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ),
    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )
)

fit <- quap( 
    f , 
    data=list(y=c(-1,1)) , 
    start=list(mu=0,sigma=1)
)

precis(fit)
```

This first runs `quap` which uses quadratic approximation for fitting the posterior. This is what we'll use for the first few weeks of the class before we use MCMC methods via Stan.

```{r}
# as of rethinking v2.21, cmdstan=TRUE is now default; therefore not necessary
fit_stan <- ulam( f , data=list(y=c(-1,1)), cmdstan = TRUE )
precis(fit_stan)
```

## Optional but highly helpful Bayesian packages

As Stan has grown in popularity, so too has Bayesian stats and a variety of package that work well with Stan.

### `rstanarm`

First, I recommend installing `rstanarm`

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rstanarm")
```

Per [its helpful vignette](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/rstanarm.html), the goal of the `rstanarm` package is to make Bayesian estimation routine for the most common regression models that applied researchers use. This will enable researchers to avoid the counter-intuitiveness of the frequentist approach to probability and statistics with only minimal changes to their existing R scripts.

To test whether the package was installed correctly, try this code:

```{r}
library(rstanarm)
```

```{r}
fit <- stan_glm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)
```

```{r}
plot(fit)
```

### `bayesplot`

Another package that is handy is `bayesplot`, which provides helpful ways to visualize results from Stan models.

To install it, you'll need to run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bayesplot")
```

You can then test it out running this code:

```{r}
library(bayesplot)
library(ggplot2) # assume you already have it installed

posterior <- as.matrix(fit)
plot_title <- ggtitle("Posterior distributions",
                      "with medians and 80% intervals")
mcmc_areas(posterior,
           pars = c("cyl", "drat", "am", "wt"),
           prob = 0.8) + plot_title
```
This can also provide helpful post-predictive checks (i.e., see model fitting), for example:

```{r}
color_scheme_set("red")
ppc_dens_overlay(y = fit$y,
                 yrep = posterior_predict(fit, draws = 50))
```

### `brms`

For most Bayesian research projects, `brms` has become the most popular R package. <https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/>

It combines the intuition of class R regression modeling (`y ~ IV1 + IV1`) with mixed effects modeling like `lme4` syntax. This class we won't use this package (maybe near the end of course) but it's incredibly helpful to think about for your final project.

Like other CRAN libraries, to install:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("brms")
```

You can then run Bayesian mixed effects modeling simply with:
```{r}
# tidybayes example: http://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/articles/tidy-brms.html
set.seed(5)
n = 10
n_condition = 5
ABC =
  data.frame(
    condition = rep(c("A","B","C","D","E"), n),
    response = rnorm(n * 5, c(0,1,2,1,-1), 0.5)
  )

library(brms)
m = brm(
  response ~ (1|condition), 
  data = ABC, 
  prior = c(
    prior(normal(0, 1), class = Intercept),
    prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), class = sd),
    prior(student_t(3, 0, 1), class = sigma)
  ),
  backend = "cmdstanr", # optional; if not specified, will use stanr
  control = list(adapt_delta = .99)
)
```

```{r}
m
```

Soloman Kurz has an amazing reproduction of our textbook but translated into `brms` as well as `tidyverse`: [Statistical rethinking with brms, ggplot2, and the tidyverse: Second edition](https://bookdown.org/content/4857/)

### `tidybayes` and `ggdist`

Last, `tidybayes` is in incredibly helpful package that combines Bayesian statistics from a [`tidy`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) perspective that underpins the [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

In addition, `tidybayes`' sister package, `ggdist`, enables incredibly powerful uncertainty visualizations via `ggplot2`.

![](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/reference/figures/preview.png)

To install these packages, you can run:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('ggdist')
install.packages('tidybayes')
```

```{r}
library(ggdist)
library(tidybayes)
library(magrittr) # part of tidyverse; install if you don't have
library(modelr) # install if you don't have; data_grid is from it

ABC %>%
  data_grid(condition) %>%
  add_epred_rvars(m) %>%
  ggplot(aes(dist = .epred, y = condition)) +
  stat_dist_dotsinterval(quantiles = 100)
```

This provides posterior means using quantile dot plots, which are frequency-format uncertainty visualizations that have showed great promise in improving decision-making ([Kay et al. 2016](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2858036.2858558), [Fernandes et al. 2018](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3173718))

### `tidybayes.rethinking`

There is even a `tidybayes` package that works specifically for the `rethinking` package. I encourage you to install this as we may 

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mjskay/tidybayes.rethinking")
```

You can now run this:
```{r}
library(tidybayes.rethinking)

# bayesian regression wt (x) on mpg (y)
m = quap(alist(
    mpg ~ dlnorm(mu, sigma),
    mu <- a + b*wt,
    c(a,b) ~ dnorm(0, 10),
    sigma ~ dexp(1)
  ),
  data = mtcars,
  start = list(a = 4, b = -1, sigma = 1)
)

m %>%
  tidybayes::tidy_draws() %>%
  tidybayes::gather_variables() %>%
  median_qi() %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = .variable, x = .value, xmin = .lower, xmax = .upper)) +
  geom_pointinterval()
```

## Package versions above

When using R (or any open source language), it's very important to keep links for package versions. I **highly** recommend running in Rmarkdown files this code at the end to timestamp what packages were used.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
