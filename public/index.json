Each type of assignment in this class is designed to help you achieve one or more of these goals.\nWeekly check-in Every week, after you finish working through the content, I want to hear about what you learned and what questions you still have. Because the content in this course is flipped, these questions are crucial for our weekly in-class discussions.\nTo encourage engagement with the course content—and to allow me to collect the class’s questions each week—you’ll need to fill out a short response on Google Forms. This should be ≈150 words. That’s fairly short: there are ≈250 words on a typical double-spaced page in Microsoft Word (500 when single-spaced).\nThese check-ins are due by noon on the days we have class. This is so I can look through the responses and start structuring the discussion for the evening’s class.\nYou should answer these two questions each week:\nWhat were the three (3) most interesting or exciting things you learned from the session? Why? What were the three (3) muddiest or unclear things from the session this week? What are you still wondering about?  You can include more than three interesting or muddiest things, but you must include at least three. There should be six easily identifiable things in each check-in: three exciting things and three questions.\nI will grade these check-ins using a check system:\n ✔+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Response shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often. ✔: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Response is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Response is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.  Notice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. I’m not grading your writing ability, I’m not counting the exact number of words you’re writing, and I’m not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. I’m looking for thoughtful engagement, three interesting things, and three questions. That’s all. Do good work and you’ll get a ✓.\nYou will submit these check-ins via Canvas\n Problem sets To practice writing R code, running inferential models, and thinking about causation, you will complete a series of problem sets.\nYou need to show that you made a good faith effort to work each question. I will not grade these in detail. The problem sets will be graded using a check system:\n ✔++: (110% in gradebook) Assignment is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔+: (100% in gradebook) Assignment is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔: (90% in gradebook) Completed provided solutions and made a valid attempt at the non-provided questions. ✔−: (50% in gradebook) Assignment is less than 50% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. ✔−−: (0% in gradebook) Assignment was not turned in I will hopefully not assign these often.  You may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers. You cannot work in groups of more than three people, and you must note who participated in the group in your assignment.\n Evaluation assignments For your final project, you will conduct a pre-registered evaluation of a social program using synthetic data. To (1) give you practice with the principles of program evaluation, research design, measurement, and causal diagrams, and (2) help you with the foundation of your final project, you will complete a set of four evaluation-related assignments.\nIdeally these will become major sections of your final project. However, there is no requirement that the programs you use in these assignments must be the same as the final project. If, through these assignments, you discover that your initially chosen program is too simple, too complex, too boring, etc., you can change at any time.\nThese assignments will be graded using a check system:\n ✔+: (33 points (110%) in gradebook) Assignment is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Document is clean and easy to follow. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often. ✔: (30 points (100%) in gradebook) Assignment is 70–99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. ✔−: (15 points (50%) in gradebook) Assignment is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.   Exams There will be one exam in the course that covers most lectures materials.\nThe exam will be in-class, paper, and without notes.\nIt will largely consist of lecture check-in questions, lecture, chapter readings, and problem sets.\nIt will be largely multiple choice questions along with short answer questions.\n Final project At the end of the course, you will demonstrate your knowledge of Bayesian statistics and causal inference by completing a final project.\nComplete details for the final project are here.\nThere is no final exam. This project is your final exam.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"https://dsba6010-spring2022.netlify.app/assignment/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"The main goals of this class are to help you design, critique, code, and run Bayesian statistical models.

You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard—R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code.1\nRStudio.cloud R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service initially, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for labs and problem sets.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud/ and create an account. You’ll receive a link to join the shared class workspace separately. If you don’t get this link, let me know and I will invite you.\n RStudio on your computer RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\nInstall R First you need to install R itself (the engine).\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)2 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\n Click on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n If you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is also 4.0.0) and download it.\n If you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n  Double click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n If you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n   Install RStudio Next, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\n The website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\n Double click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n  Double click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n Install tidyverse R packages are easy to install with RStudio. Select the packages panel, click on “Install,” type the name of the package you want to install, and press enter.\nThis can sometimes be tedious when you’re installing lots of packages, though. The tidyverse, for instance, consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nGo to the packages panel in RStudio, click on “Install,” type “tidyverse”, and press enter. You’ll see a bunch of output in the RStudio console as all the tidyverse packages are installed.\nNotice also that RStudio will generate a line of code for you and run it: install.packages(\"tidyverse\"). You can also just paste and run this instead of using the packages panel.\n Install tinytex When you knit to PDF, R uses a special scientific typesetting program named LaTeX (pronounced “lay-tek” or “lah-tex”; for goofy nerdy reasons, the x is technically the “ch” sound in “Bach”, but most people just say it as “k”—saying “layteks” is frowned on for whatever reason).\nLaTeX is neat and makes pretty documents, but it’s a huge program—the macOS version, for instance, is nearly 4 GB! To make life easier, there’s an R package named tinytex that installs a minimal LaTeX program and that automatically deals with differences between macOS and Windows.\nHere’s how to install tinytex so you can knit to pretty PDFs:\nUse the Packages in panel in RStudio to install tinytex like you did above with tidyverse. Alternatively, run install.packages(\"tinytex\") in the console. Run tinytex::install_tinytex() in the console. Wait for a bit while R downloads and installs everything you need. The end! You should now be able to knit to PDF.     These instructions were created by Andrew Heiss from his excellent Program Evaluation course website.↩︎\n It’s a goofy name, but CRAN is where most R packages—and R itself—lives.↩︎\n   ","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"efb59c0882a965443ffcbafa3cd27ca6","permalink":"https://dsba6010-spring2022.netlify.app/resource/install/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/install/","section":"resource","summary":"You will do all of your work in this class with the open source (and free!) programming language R.

How does it differ in its definition of uncertainty from Frequentist interpretations?   An approach to count all the ways data can happen according to assumptions.\n  Bayesian data analysis uses probabilities to describe uncertainty. Importantly, in Bayesian data analysis probabilities describe degrees of belief. In contrast, a frequentist interpretation of probabilities would be as the frequencies of events in very large samples.\n  This leads to frequentist uncertainty being premised on imaginary resampling of data—if we were to repeat the measurement many many times, we would end up collecting a list of values that will have some pattern to it. It means also that parameters and models cannot have probability distributions, only measurements can.\n   Classical (Frequentist) statistical tests were originally developed for what purposes?   They were originally developed (largely by Ronald Fisher) in the early 20th century for agricultural applications. They typically were for randomized experiments with large effects, in which measurement issues had been solved.\n  Such statistical tests produce inferences, not decisions.\n   What is the core problem with null hypothesis testing?   Models are not hypotheses; they are neither true or false. Models are \u0026ldquo;golems\u0026rdquo; that do as they are told.\n  Ideally should compare performance across models (model comparison).\n  Popper: test (attempt to falsify) research hypothesis. Use theory, make a falsifiable prediction, and test that; not that nothing happened (aka null hypothesis).\n   What are three ways in which cross-validation and information theory aid in model evaluation?   They provide useful expectations of predictive accuracy, rather than merely fit to sample. So they compare models where it matters.\n  They give us an estimate of the tendency of a model to overfit. This will help us to understand how models and data interact, which in turn helps us to design better models.\n  They help us to spot highly influential observations.\n   We will cover these topics in Lesson 8.   What are the benefits of using multilevel (aka hierarchical) models?   They acknowledge that, though each individual group might have its own model, one group can provide valuable information about another. That is, \u0026ldquo;let’s learn from one another while celebrating our individuality.\u0026quot;\n  We will cover these later in the course.\n   Feedback Go to this form and answer these three questions:\nWhat was the muddiest thing from class this lesson? What are you still wondering about? What was the clearest thing from class this lesson? What was the most exciting thing you learned?
