```{r assignments-grades, include=FALSE}
assignments <- tribble(
  ~Percent,  ~Assignment,
  "10%" , "Attendance & Participation",
  "10%" , "4 Datacamp courses",
  "20%" , "4 Problem sets",
  "20%" , "4 Online Quizzes",
  "10%" , "Group: Design Contest",
  "30%" , "Group: Final Project"
)

  ~Grade, ~Range,
  "A (Comendable)",  "90% – 100%", 
  "B (Satisfactory)",  "80% – 89.99%", 
  "C (Marginal)",  "70% – 79.99%",
  "U (Unsatisfactory)",  "< 70%"
)

# Policies:

* Quizzes **cannot** be turned in late.

  - DataCamp and Problem Sets get **50%** penalty 1 day. 0% credit longer.

* Formal announcements sent thru email.

  - Informal announcements sent thru Slack.
  
  - Canvas will only be for assignment submission and tracking grades.
  
---

# Policies

* Collaboration is encouraged (except quizzes)
  
  - Projects in groups of 3 (you select).
  
  - Problem sets can work in pairs.
  
  - Cannot work together on quizzes.
  
* RStudio.Cloud is available to run examples.
  
  - Students are encouraged (but not required) to learn to run locally.

## Course Communication

For many students, a lot of the course material may be very new. 

Many students' first reaction when get first R error message or question on programming is to email me.

---

## When you have R/run questions:

1. Google it!

2. Ask a classmate.

3. Post your question on the course Slack channel. I'll likely answer it.

4. Email me at last resort.

> Avoid saying: "I'm not a programmer, computer scientist, [or whatever else], therefore..."
Data Scientist Creed: If you don't know it, learn it.

## Course Material

If you have course or personal questions (excuse absences, personal issues, etc.), that's when to email me.
